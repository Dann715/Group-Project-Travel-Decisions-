# Group Project Travel Decisions

## **Description**
The **Travel Decisions** system is designed to help users make informed travel decisions based on their personal preferences. By leveraging APIs like **TripAdvisor**, **OpenWeatherMap**, and **Amadeus**, our application suggests travel destinations tailored to user input such as budget, weather, and distance.

The intuitive interface allows users to search their desired city and it will return weather data. The goal is to simplify travel planning and enhance the user experience by providing data driven travel options.
